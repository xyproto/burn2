If you're a user, this is all you need to run burn:

   burn.exe - the executable
   burn.dat - data file


If you're planning to compile Burn by yourself,
you probably need these files (and ie. turbo pascal):

   burn.pas - sourcecode for the executable
   burnit.pas - sourcecode for a unit
   newcrt.tpu - a tiny ripped unit


Most people don't need these files:

   file_id.diz - a really, really short description


Some people might like to have a look at these files:

   burndoc.txt - unfinished cmd overview
   readme.txt - a few helpful hints
   files.txt - this file
