This is the readme for Burn v.1.0 (unstable beta 9). (GPL licensed)

   Burn is currently not finished, but you might
   find it usefull in its current state.



You probably want to know this:

   "save bmp filename.bmp" exports your image to a bmp file.

   Type "save" to see possible export formats.

   Remember to save your file as "bip" to enable easy loding in the future.
   "load filename.bip" loads your image.



You should also take a look at "files.txt".



( Yes, I'm planning to make a better quickstart-guide. :) )
